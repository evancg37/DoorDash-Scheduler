# DoorDash Scheduler

~~A Python script that can use an Android emulator to automatically schedule a shift on the DoorDash Dasher app for a specific time frame. Scheduling occurs automatically as soon as the schedule is uploaded in the morning by DoorDash. The bot can run 24/7 with a predetermined weekly schedule with a specific shift (or none) for each day.~~

Does not work, sorry. Old unfinished project from years ago.
